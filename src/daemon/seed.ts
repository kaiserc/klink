// Headless seed mode: make a torrent out of files you already have, and serve
// them to the swarm.
//
// Every other way into torlink starts from a torrent somebody else made. This
// is the origin case, and it is the one thing the client could not do: search
// finds torrents, the watch folder is handed them, the API is posted them —
// none of that helps when the content is yours and no torrent for it exists.
//
// The order matters and is the whole trick. Create the .torrent first, write it
// beside the data, then add it BY PATH. Adding the magnet instead would be
// correct and useless: a magnet carries no piece hashes, so the client has to
// fetch metadata from the swarm before it can verify anything — and the swarm
// for a torrent nobody has ever seen has no one in it to fetch from. It would
// sit at zero per cent forever, seeding data that is already on the disk under
// it. Handed the .torrent, it verifies locally and is seeding in seconds.
